# EvenBetterDeferral
This is a script that builds on Haircut's "Better JAMF Deferral" script. 

This adds support for checking running apps and skipping prompt if App to be updated isn't running. 

It also adds support for modifying "Blocking" apps at runtime (i.e. if Keynote is running, suppress update). 

Future updates may include options for modifying custom messaging at runtime, and program logic for ignoring blocking apps if app to be updated won't require a prompt.
